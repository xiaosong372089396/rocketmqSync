# rocketmqSync

Cluster Topic Synchronization Tool

```
Because there is a problem with the client maintained by the apache/rocketmq-client-go community, I have submitted issus to wait for the community to fix the bug and improve the function after the community fixes it
At this stage, the topic data can be read from cluster A and output
```


```
因当前apache/rocketmq-client-go社区维护的客户端存在bugs,我已多次测试验证，我已经提交issus了等待社区修复bug，等待社区修复后完善功能
目前阶段支持从A集群读取topic数据并输出
```
